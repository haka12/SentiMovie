https://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-fast-and-furious-hobbs-and-shaw-very-furious-not-so-fast,A review by msbreviews,If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :),Here’s the thing about the Fast & Furious franchise: it can be dumb fun. Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic… As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can’t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn’t and take everything seriously. It’s not that you can’t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that’s reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it’s not easy (at all) to bala... "
1,Furious 7,"April3,2015",Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for his comatose brother., English,"{'VinDiesel': ['DominicToretto'], 'PaulWalker': [""BrianO'Conner""], 'DwayneJohnson': ['Hobbs'], 'MichelleRodriguez': ['Letty'], 'TyreseGibson': ['Roman']}","{'Characters': ['Gary Scott Thompson'], 'Director': ['James Wan'], 'Writer': ['Chris Morgan']}","Action,Crime,Thriller"," $190,000,000.00"," $1,506,249,360.00", 2h 17m,"A review by Kenechukwu,Revenge is so so cold...... action packed, thrilling and suspense filled but still some bits of make believe tricks here and there. 
How did Hobbs know that there's a need for the drone to be brought down right after leaving the hospital bed? how did he know where the drone was at the moment when he left with the ambulance? How did Deckard Shaw know both that Toretto and his crew will be both on the route of Afghanistan and also when they were at Abu Dhabi? 
Its a little bit odd and out of place for the director and script editor.... 
As for the next upcoming part in the franchise, i think M... ,A review by Per Gunnar Jonsson,This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.,This movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this parti... "
2,The Fate of the Furious,"April14,2017,June27,2017,July11,2017","When a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime and a betrayal of those closest to him, the crew face trials that will test them as never before.", English,"VinDiesel,DominicToretto,JasonStatham,DeckardShaw,DwayneJohnson,LukeHobbs,MichelleRodriguez,LettyOrtiz,TyreseGibson,RomanPearce","Gary Scott Thompson,Characters,F.

A cyber terrorist called Cipher (Charlize Theron) has something on Dom, enough to get him to turn his back on his family and go rogue.,Hobbs ends up in jail because of Dom's betrayal. Even worse he is the same block as Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) the man he put in jail in the last film.,Mr Nobody (Kurt Russell) manipulates both Hobbs and Shaw to team up, together with Dom's crew they go after... ,A review by Gimly,Might be the dumbest of the franchise to date, and if nothing else, that's an achievement. More importantly, , continues the tradition that the series has upheld since all the way back in the... half-way point: ,. That was when these movies actually got bearable, and , delivers on the promise of that fun.,A review by Reno,We all miss Paul Walker here, but the franchise has grown bigger with more new casts from a couple of previous installments and with this, still counting. Yes, it marks the arrival of Jason Stathom as hinted at the end of the previous part, as well as Charlize Theron in the negative role. And guest appearance of veteran actors. This is where the bald guys rule. One of the most unique franchise.,This is the costliest film in the series, but did not earn as much as 'Fast 7' did. At least it stands second out of the eight. Now the billion dollar club becoming normal.... ,A review by Per Gunnar Jonsson,home the man who made them a family.,This movie could easily have been a five out of five stars movie. The story is not that bad but the script and the special effects are absolutely ludicrous. Do not get me wrong, the special effects are, in terms of visual effects quality, really good but they are also utterly unbelievable.,What kind of total idiot did they put to play out his juvenile wet FX dreams on this one? I do not mind over the top special effects and I do not demand 100% realism, at least not in a movie like this, but the effects in this one is just so unbelievable and unintelli... "
