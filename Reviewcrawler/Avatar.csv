The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical other world that keeps us fascinated. I like this film and I have written many review for essay writing service. The special effects are so good here that you don't even notice them. It is eerie how Cameron has made it look and feel like he is just pointing a camera at the action.", 2h 42m,Avatar
