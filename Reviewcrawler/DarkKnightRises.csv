The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.,I expected a little more , than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms—it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I f... ,A review by Chris,I personally thought this film is on par if not better than the Dark Knight.,Whilst some think the film is too long for the story I didn't find this. The length of the film is longer than some (but doesn't feel it), I liked that the film took it's time rather than shoving more elements in it - I think this contributed to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed and calm before the final crescendo).,At the end of the day whether you like this film will boil down to if you like films Christopher Nolan has directed and/or you like the Christopher Nolan Batman... ,A review by GeekMasher,The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best movies to come out in 2012. The story compels you to watch it time and time again. It also has I of, I my opinion, the best bad guys in any movie, Bane! Batman was well played as all ways and the cast where well selected. I think this movie is the best batman to see the light of day or the darkest nights (pun intended).,A review by Im_Infinity,No doubt that the movie is one of the best movies of this era.
The film doesn't lack in whatever it try to do.It has Simple narration with extraordinary Direction,Acting,Music,Cinematography and a lot of qualities.
Christian Bale is supremely entertaining for sure.
The person behind the scenes is actually the real core creater of the film yes! The Director Christopher Nolan ❤ .
The film ofcorse completes with philosophical quality loaded with Lots of Sacrifices.
This one is the one you surely can't afford to miss.
Go watch The Dark Knight.Go now.,A review by talisencrw,While it's clearly not as superlative as its famous predecessor, it's simply because of both Heath Ledger's outstanding and Oscar-winning performance, and the character of the Joker's etching in our collective unconscious as the greatest comic-book villain ever created (with Lex Luthor a very distant second place). This is still a masterwork, and is an excellent coda to the finest filmic trilogy ever made. As great as Christopher Nolan is as a director, and as fine a film as 'Interstellar' is, I really don't know if he'll ever be able to top his work here, on these three films. But I, for one,... ,A review by DoryDarko,So here we have it. The end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of Batman through the eyes of Christopher Nolan. And baby, it goes out with a bang...,Going into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins, but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.,This third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plent... ,A review by Per Gunnar Jonsson,Batman was one of my childhood heroes from the Comic magazines even though the Swedish plonkers, in their infinite stupidity, had renamed him to something as ridiculous “Läderlappen” which basically translates into “patch of leather”.,Thus, when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.,I think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn’t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If...
