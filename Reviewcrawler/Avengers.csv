While as might be expected, R. Downey Jr. comes across largely central, it is still a good mix and IMHO the best scenes in the movie involve the generated Hulk character.,With that kind of successful melding of characters, Hollywood-scale egos and even computer generated characters; you have to give it up to the writers and director to make this the successful film that it is.,A review by Gimly,My new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;,I had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.,I think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel... ,A review by Per Gunnar Jonsson,After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abysmal second instalment of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.,The special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some “depth” to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.,I’ve always liked Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrol... ,A review by tmdb44006625,One of the few movies to actually make me feel like a kid again, Joss Whedon was the perfect filmmaker to do this film. Everyone gets their time to shine. The script juggles every plot point and character moment with clarity and ease. It's funny, smart, and visually jaw dropping. Definitely lived up to the five movie hype.,A review by E.J. Cummings,I give this 10 Stars based on it being not only better than the trailer and the hype made me thing it would be, but also that it was the first time anything the size and scope of the Marvel Cinematic universe was pulled off successfully. Having Joss direct this movie lives and dies on character interaction. This movie is on the definitive list in my opinion even just for that.,A review by John Chard,Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.,The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard.

Visually stunning.  So much going on, but somehow also clear and easy to understand.  A little flabby in the middle third, but given the huge cast and story to cover it is very understandable.  The highlight was the parings of characters from different stories and their interactions.,If you aren't a Marvel fan this film won't convert you, but if you have liked any of the previous films you will like this too.,10/10,A review by Gimly,Just a very short, NO SPOILERS review I wanted to get down while it's still fresh.,For a movie with this much riding it, to come out not feeling disappointed, is a , achievement. While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about ,, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen , at this point, and th... ,A review by Law,The third act turns on a character being an idiot. That story beat renders all that the heroes do before and after it immaterial. That moment so preoccupied me that I couldn't enjoy the rest of the story, and made it impossible to ignore the flick's other glaring flaws anymore: the villain's motive makes no sense, the glove exists only to produce plot contrivances, the score is so obvious it might as well be cue cards on screen (""Feel sad now"") ...,The first half is some of the best action in a Disney Marvel entry yet, and the other half is so stupid that it sours the whole MCU experience.,A review by Ch Walid,Best MCU movie, more than that.... BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER. Hands Down,A review by hs.rohit,Nice Movie.,A review by Movie Queen41,Massive, epic movie. I'm so happy that Marvel is stepping up their game with their villains. For too long, MCU villains have been too bland and generic. But lately, the villains have improved with Michael Keaton's Vulture, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and now James Brolin's Thanos. Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film,... ,A review by jmquint00,Best Movie Ever...,A review by Wuchak,RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.,The story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man.

Every now and then there would be a good scene or piece of dialogue but for the most part I felt myself getting bored and reaching for my phone to play Cribbage. I guess what I didn't like most is that it all felt like a big filler episode instead of an action packed character driven story arc.,A review by Andres Gomez,Action, good Fx and a ""not-completely-absurd"" story. The actors perform well and you can identify them very well with their characters ... but it is all old and without imagination.,I suppose nobody was expecting anything else, though ...,A review by Per Gunnar Jonsson,This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.,The movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold.

About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at.

But the sad fact is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is really just a run of the mill ""bad guy wants to destroy the world for reasons"" actioner that we've seen done better many times before.,Don't get me wrong. The movie's fun. The dialogue is frequently clever and humourous. And I really appreciated the quiet bits of storytelling that Whedon was able to sneak in.

This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing.
