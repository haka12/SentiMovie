Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived.,Picking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. ,As time passes and they struggle to accept the r... ,A review by Gimly,Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see , again.,Putting it out there right from the get-go, , is my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may pr... ,A review by msbreviews,If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :),Don't worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it's such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible sag... ,A review by heroman,okay so if your like me you questioned this movie due to the fact that i personally thought nothing could beat infinity war well after seeing it i can honestly say we have a new champion this was absolutley excelent so hilarious action packed the 3 hrs passes extremily fast my only thing is the use of god.... bothered me and i suggest if your offended by that wait till dvd so you can mute the parts also a reminder to parents 'no matter how bad you want to see the movie dont do like people in my theater did and bring your 3 year old 'but besides that awesome movie,A review by courtlynn,We waited till day 5 of release in theaters. There was a slow start to the movie so i don't recommend taking little ones under the age of 10. After all the anticipation and hype,Avengers Endgame did not disappoint. Waa a perfect ""ending' to the series. Very well done,A review by Per Gunnar Jonsson,These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.,I have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier a... ,A review by swapnake,Awesome!,A review by Wuchak,How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren’t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I’ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).,“Endgame” (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing.
